King Of Ether is a blockchain game that follows a pyramid scheme structure.

Any address can become the new king. For that, it needs to pay the value (in ether) to the throne. If someone pays the throne premium, then that address becomes the new king and the premium is donated to the old king. 

As long as a new king arrives, everyone wins money. The only that doesn't is the last of them all. 

In this contract we introduced mechanisms with payable addresses and balances in ether and wei. Asides from that, we also used a typical fee + withdraw pattern.

The main goal of this exercise, however, was to use etherscan to interact with the contract and track balances moving between user addresses, the smart contract address and the developer's address.
